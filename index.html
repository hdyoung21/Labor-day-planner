        <h1>Labor Day weekend at the Lodge 8/31-9/4</h1>
        <p id="welcome">
            You have been invited to a guys retreat at Youngs Lodge on the Chariton in Callao, MO for Labor day weekend.
            The reservation is set for Thursday to Monday which is labor day with an estimated 18 people (room for 25). I have the rental covered and all that is asked of you is to show up and leave some gratuity for the lodge crew when leaving.  Bring your guns, boots, fishing poles, and clothes you can get dirty.  Booze will be ordered ahead of time so it is there when we arive, we can have the fridge stocked for us as well.  Most meals we will prepare ourselves but there are catering options when we choose to do so.  The Lodge will be holding an off roading event that saturday that we will be able to enjoy and jump in for some rides.  Currently we are on the search for a vehicle we can use for that weekend.  Missouri is also recreational at this point so theres that.  You are welcome to invite friends as well just let me know so I can keep an accurate head count.  If you want to see pictures check out the official website at <a href="https://www.youngslodge.com/">https://www.youngslodge.com/</a>.  First come first serve on choice of rooms.  There are 5 cabins and then 6 bedrooms in the main lodge plus pullouts and couches.  Please plan ahead for your travel plans.

            <p class="directions">
                Kirksville is a small city about 40 minutes north of the lodge that would be a good option for getting picked up from the airport or ubering.  The flight is gennerally another $25-50 than KC or STL but 2 hours closer.  Uber is available up there but its hit or miss.  Depending on number of people trying to fly into Kirksville we may rent a van.

            <p class="directions">
                Flying into Kansas City puts you about 2 1/2 hours away from the lodge with a few riverboat casinos on the way.  If you dont want to pay for a rental the entire weekend look at dropping off your vehicle in kirksville the following day or plan with others to rent a van. Enterprise would be my suggestion if wanting to drop car.

            <h2 id="STL">St. Louis</h2>
            <p class="directions">
                Flying into St. Louis leaves about a 3 hour drive to the Lodge.  Enterprise is suggested if you would like to rent a car just for the days you are traveling as they have a drop off near by.

                The Lodge is about a 750 mile or 12 hour drive from Atlanta.  Carpooling is suggested and if you dont have anyone you are planning to ride with let me know and ill connect you with others.
